## Disclaimer

This application provides health guidance and triage recommendations based on advanced machine learning models trained on medical data. It is designed to support healthcare decision-making but is not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. In emergency situations, always contact local emergency services immediately.

The system has been validated against medical standards and shows high accuracy, but all AI recommendations should be reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals when possible.
